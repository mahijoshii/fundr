Some programs are targeted at creating connections between researchers, building capacity, and enabling competitive research output. Graduate students are eligible for scholarships, fellowships, and external awards. These may cover research costs, travel, living expenses, tuition or fees depending on the grant. Non-graduate researchers (faculty or staff) may also receive funding for infrastructure, collaborations, or developing new research themes. One internal program provides relatively modest awards for undergraduate students for creative or scholarly work; these cover project\u2010related expenses (excluding travel, salaries, or membership fees). Another internal program enables student-faculty collaborative research, both for undergraduate and graduate levels; this typically includes a stipend plus funds for supplies and sometimes travel. There are external programs listed which include funding from provincial sources, national research councils, and innovation partners. These tend to be larger in scale, intended to support infrastructure, strategic research priorities, and projects that cross disciplines or address broader societal challenges. Across the programs, award sizes vary. For small undergraduate project grants, amounts are up to several hundred dollars. For graduate-level and external awards, amounts are substantially higher (thousands of dollars), depending on scope. Eligibility generally includes being enrolled as a student (undergraduate or graduate), maintaining academic standing, having a faculty mentor, sometimes being a resident of a particular region or meeting specific demographic criteria (e.g. underrepresented group, financial need).

Another internal program enables student-faculty collaborative research, both for undergraduate and graduate levels; this typically includes a stipend plus funds for supplies and sometimes travel. There are external programs listed which include funding from provincial sources, national research councils, and innovation partners. These tend to be larger in scale, intended to support infrastructure, strategic research priorities, and projects that cross disciplines or address broader societal challenges. Across the programs, award sizes vary. For small undergraduate project grants, amounts are up to several hundred dollars. For graduate-level and external awards, amounts are substantially higher (thousands of dollars), depending on scope.
