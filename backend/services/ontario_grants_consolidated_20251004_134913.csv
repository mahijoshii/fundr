Creative Research and Arts Fellowship for Mid-Career Innovators in Ontario (Canada),"View Full Grant Details There are multiple funding programs available through the university’s research & graduate studies unit, supporting researchers, graduate students, and sometimes faculty. These grants are offered by internal funds and external agencies. They aim to support research infrastructure (especially smaller-scale), project-based research in various disciplines (engineering, health sciences, humanities, social sciences), and innovation. Some programs are targeted at creating connections between researchers, building capacity, and enabling competitive research output. Graduate students are eligible for scholarships, fellowships, and external awards. These may cover research costs, travel, living expenses, tuition or fees depending on the grant. Non-graduate researchers (faculty or staff) may also receive funding for infrastructure, collaborations, or developing new research themes. One internal program provides relatively modest awards for undergraduate students for creative or scholarly work; these cover project‐related expenses (excluding travel, salaries, or membership fees). Another internal program enables student-faculty collaborative research, both for undergraduate and graduate levels; this typically includes a stipend plus funds for supplies and sometimes travel. There are external programs listed which include funding from provincial sources, national research councils, and innovation partners. These tend to be larger in scale, intended to support infrastructure, strategic research priorities, and projects that cross disciplines or address broader societal challenges. Across the programs, award sizes vary. For small undergraduate project grants, amounts are up to several hundred dollars. For graduate-level and external awards, amounts are substantially higher (thousands of dollars), depending on scope. Eligibility generally includes being enrolled as a student (undergraduate or graduate), maintaining academic standing, having a faculty mentor, sometimes being a resident of a particular region or meeting specific demographic criteria (e.g. underrepresented group, financial need). The intent of these funds is to enable academic research, creative activity, capacity building, training, and dissemination of results rather than general operations. Deadlines for proposals are multiple, depending on the program.

Grant for Projects Advancing Child Survival Solutions in Ontario (Canada),"View Full Grant Details This global challenge invites anyone—individuals, nonprofits, for-profits, academic institutions, or government entities—to craft proposals that genuinely work toward saving the lives of children under age five. While applications may come from around the world, the prize funds must be used strictly for charitable purposes aligned with the contest’s goals. Past offerings have included a significant award—such as $150,000—for a compelling project focused on infrastructure or interventions that directly address child mortality. The emphasis is on real-world impact and measurable outcomes, with submissions best designed as ready-to-execute plans grounded in evidence and scalability. The process unfolds in three stages. The first stage starts with an accessible entry form to introduce your idea. If selected, you'll be invited to submit an in-depth proposal with detailed materials, such as budgets, evidence of impact, and media. Finalists then participate in a Q&A round with the judging panel, after which a winner is chosen. Applicants should highlight how their plan will save lives among young children—preferably by making them reach age five who otherwise wouldn’t have. Demonstrating strong evidence, scalability, cost-effectiveness, feasibility, and ease of verifying results is essential. You may even use proxies for mortality (like morbidity), but only if you clearly justify how they relate to actual survival in your target community. In essence, this opportunity empowers scientifically grounded, high-impact interventions designed to curb child mortality. It supports bold, well-documented plans that are poised to save lives—and encourages sharing those stories to inspire broader support and action.

Global Filmmaker Grant Award for Transformative Storytelling in Ontario (Canada),"View Full Grant Details This creative grant opportunity supports short film projects—five minutes or less—that center on mental health themes. Designed to help bring personal, genuine stories to life, it provides production funding to small filmmaking teams. The aim is to encourage projects that explore emotional depth, healing, connection, and resilience through any storytelling lens—including drama, comedy, animation, documentary, experimental, or even sci-fi and westerns. The opportunity is open to filmmakers from anywhere in the world. It supports small collaborative teams, not individuals working solo, and is tailored to creators who are passionate about mental health storytelling. It’s not available for non-film initiatives, and business-oriented or individual non-creative applications do not match the focus. Winners receive a lump-sum grant designed to help with the costs of production—such as equipment, editing, or crew expenses—so the story can be told effectively and with quality. Alongside funding, the opportunity includes indirect support: informational sessions and workshops help guide the proposal process, and applicants may benefit from limited one-on-one feedback to shape their ideas and budgets. This grant is offered on an annual cycle, with application windows opening each year, followed by a submission deadline. A panel of judges reviews the proposals, generally selecting several recipients who are then invited to complete and share their films, often with support for broader visibility through educational or community networks. Ultimately, this grant empowers small filmmaking teams to create heartfelt, meaningful content that resonates with audiences, invites dialogue on mental health, and fosters empathy—while elevating voices and perspectives that often go unheard.
